# SIMRU | Room Management Information System

## 📝 Description
SIMRU (Sistem Manajemen Ruangan) is a centralized platform designed to streamline room scheduling and monitoring at PENS. This project was built to replace manual, fragmented reservation processes with a high-performance digital infrastructure, ensuring transparency and real-time data accuracy for both students and staff.

## 🚀 Features
* **Real-time Availability**: Monitor room status (Available/Reserved) instantly based on selected dates.
* **Digital Reservation**: User-friendly booking system with metadata support (borrower name, purpose, and timing).
* **Active Data Management**: Integrated tools for administrators to search, edit, or delete active schedules.
* **Audit-Ready History**: Automated activity logs providing a full history of past room usage for transparency.
* **Advanced Search**: High-performance, debounced search bar to filter entries by borrower or room name.
* **Modern UI/UX**: A v1.1.0 refactored interface focused on a monochrome-minimalist "builder" aesthetic.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Backend**: .NET (C#) for robust business logic and data persistence.
* **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript for type-safe, responsive component architecture.
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a sharp, monochrome-slate design system.
* **Icons**: Lucide React for professional-grade iconography.
